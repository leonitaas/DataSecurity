Polybius Square Cipher and Myszkowski Transposition Project

Interaction professor Arbena Musa

# Language
Project Polybius is developed in Java language and Myszkowski in Python language.

# Usage
Polybius Square Cipher is a substitution cipher that replaces pairs of letters with coordinates in a grid. The grid typically consists of 5 rows and 5 columns, with letters of the alphabet (usually excluding "J") written inside, each identified by their coordinates.Polybius provides a simple yet effective method of encryption, particularly suitable for handwritten messages.

Myszkowski Transposition involves rearranging the plaintext characters based on a keyword or phrase.he keyword determines the order of rearrangement. Repeated letters in the keyword are numbered sequentially to indicate their order in the transposition.The plaintext is written out in rows, with the length of each row determined by the length of the keyword. Then, the columns are rearranged according to the numerical order of the keyword letters.
